Band4Band is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to engage in band-versus-band matches while wagering cryptocurrency. Users can connect their wallets via MetaMask, create profiles, and participate in matches where the winner receives the wager amount from the loser. The project emphasizes anonymity until the end of each match to maintain privacy.

## Features

- **User Authentication with MetaMask**: Seamless integration with MetaMask for user wallet management and authentication.
- **User Profile Creation**: Users can create profiles with usernames, profile pictures, and other relevant information.
- **Anonymity Until the End of Each Match**: User profiles and wallet addresses are kept anonymous until the end of each match.
- **Band for Band Matches**: Smart contracts handle the band-versus-band matches fairly and transparently.
- **Instant Transfer of Funds**: Smart contracts facilitate instant transfers of $1000 from the loser to the winner's wallet.
- **Reveal Wallet Addresses and Amounts**: Wallet addresses and match amounts are revealed at the end of each match and recorded on the blockchain.

## Technologies Used

- **Ethereum Smart Contracts**: Solidity is used to write the smart contracts that manage user profiles, matches, and fund transfers.
- **Web3.js**: Enables interaction with the Ethereum blockchain from the front-end.
- **MetaMask**: Simplifies user authentication and wallet management.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: Used for the front-end user interface and forms.
- **Node.js and Express.js**: Create the back-end for user data management and smart contract interactions.
- **Traditional Database**: User profiles and wallet addresses are stored off-chain for anonymity (e.g., MySQL or MongoDB).
