Band4Band is a blockchain-based platform that allows users to engage in band-versus-band matches while wagering cryptocurrency. Users can connect their wallets via MetaMask, create profiles, and participate in matches where the winner receives $1000 from the loser. The project emphasizes anonymity until the end of each match to maintain privacy.

## Features

- **User Authentication with MetaMask**: Seamless integration with MetaMask for user wallet management and authentication.
- **User Profile Creation**: Users can create profiles with usernames, profile pictures, and other relevant information.
- **Anonymity Until the End of Each Match**: User profiles and wallet addresses are kept anonymous until the end of each match.
- **Band for Band Matches**: Smart contracts handle the band-versus-band matches fairly and transparently.
- **Instant Transfer of Funds**: Smart contracts facilitate instant transfers of $1000 from the loser to the winner's wallet.
- **Reveal Wallet Addresses and Amounts**: Wallet addresses and match amounts are revealed at the end of each match and recorded on the blockchain.

## Technologies Used

- **Ethereum Smart Contracts**: Solidity is used to write the smart contracts that manage user profiles, matches, and fund transfers.
- **Web3.js**: Enables interaction with the Ethereum blockchain from the front-end.
- **MetaMask**: Simplifies user authentication and wallet management.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: Used for the front-end user interface and forms.
- **Node.js and Express.js**: Create the back-end for user data management and smart contract interactions.
- **Traditional Database**: User profiles and wallet addresses are stored off-chain for anonymity (e.g., MySQL or MongoDB).
